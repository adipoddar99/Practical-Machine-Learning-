## Reproducibility  
In order to reproducee the samee resultss, you needd a certainn set of packkages as well as seetting a psseudo random seeed equual to the onne I have ussed.  
`Note`: To installl, for insttance, the `rattle` packkage in R, run thhis commannd: `install.packages("rattle")`.  
The followwing Librarries were ussed for this prroject, whiich you shoould install and load them in your working envirronment.  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(rattle)
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(corrplot)
library(randomForest)
library(RColorBrewer)
```  
Finnally, looad the same seeed with the folloowing line of coode:  
```{r warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
set.seed(56789)
```
